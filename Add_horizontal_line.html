<HTML>
<head> <h1> My new HTML line break </h1> </head>
<title> Ins_Horizontal_line </title>
<body> This is an example of inserting line break
<br> <hr align = "left" width = "100%">
The line will come in a separate line
<p> To use a line break use the br tag </p>
And I love to learn this type of Html programs from our parts
